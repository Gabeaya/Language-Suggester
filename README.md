## Description
_This web application was created to provide the user with a forms survey that would help them decide which coding language they should learn first. Answering the questions differently will provide them with a different suggested language, with four total language options. The user will be able to switch, based on preference, from light to dark modes within the website and will also be able to submit their name and email to win a free intro course at Epicodus._
